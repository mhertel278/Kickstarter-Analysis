# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise has started a Kickstarter campaign to fund her play *Fever*.  The campaign has quickly come close to reaching its fundraising goal. The purpose of the following analysis is to provide Louise with insights into the likelyhood of her campaign reaching its goal.  The analysis was performed on data in an excel spreadsheet for several kickstarter campaigns.  The data for each campaign included details such as Project Name, goal and pledged amounts, country in which the campaign took place, the outcome of the campaign, the launch and deadline dates, and category and subcategory of the project in the campaign.  

## Analysis and Challenges

In doing this analysis, I first examined how the time of year Kickstarter campaigns launched affected the out come of the campaigns.  Second I focused on how the amount of the campaign goals affected the outcomes.  

I focused on projects in the **theater** category.  The original data set listed category and subcategory in the same column ![category_subcategory_column](resources/category_subcategory_column.png).  I added additional columns to the spreadsheet and used the Text to Columns feature to split the category and subcategory information into the columns *Parent Category* and *Subcategory*.  



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In order to examine how launch date affected the outcomes of Theater projects, I created a pivot table from the full data set.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
